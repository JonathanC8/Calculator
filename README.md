Calculator

My first major C++ project
I will be using this project to further my understanding and knowledge of C++ so I can hone my skills in application development.

Check the unstable branch for my latest updates to the code which still create code breaking errors.

Changelog:

  V0.1:
  
    - Uploaded to github
    - Very basic calculator that can run basic math operations in expression form
    - Example: 2+2 Outputs: 4 | 2 * 2 Outputs: 4
    - Finds the Mode of an array I made; I made this to see if I could do median and mode in C++ will be eloberated on in future updates

Roadmap:
  - Form a GUI with Dear ImGUI
  - Formulate "advanced" expressions
  - Solve algebraic expressions
  - Calculate common conversions
