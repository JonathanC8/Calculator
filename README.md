Calculator

My first major C++ project
I will be using this project to further my understanding and knowledge of C++ so I can hone my skills in application development.

Check the unstable branch for my latest updates to the code which still create code breaking errors.

# Changelog:

 - Uploaded to github
 - Very basic calculator that can run basic math operations in expression form
 - Example: 2+2 Outputs: 4 | 2 * 2 Outputs: 4
 - Finds the Mode of an array I made; I made this to see if I could do median and mode in C++ will be eloberated on in future updates
